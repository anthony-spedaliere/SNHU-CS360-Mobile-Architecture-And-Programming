Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The client specifications were as follows: 1. Develop code that allows a user to log in. 2. Develop code to create a database shell and display that database's information on a user's screen using a grid. 3. Develop code that prompts users for permission to send SMS messaging notifcations and makes the app function based on the individual user's response. 4. Employ industry standard best practices such as in-line comments and appropriate naming conventions to enhance readability of code.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
A log in screen and a recycler view were the two main screens used to support the user needs. There were secondary screens used to facilitate the other functionality of the application such as an update screen, delete screen and new item screen. The UI was designed with simplicity in mind. Common symbols were used that the user would know the meaning of and be able to use with little explanation. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
The coding process was implemented in phases. I chose to create a list of to-do items. Each item was meant to build upon the next item. In this way I started building my app from it's foundation up. I think building apps incrementally is a good way to develop an app because it breaks the process into manageable chunks.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Android Studio provides an emulator for testing purposes. I also invited friends and family to test the application to see if they could provide feedback or find bugs. This process is important because it can reveal bugs in the code through user interaction that a developer might never consider. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
There was a design flaw in the inventory update process of my application. I had to rethink how I would achieve this. Inevitably, I chose to re-code that portion of my project and achieve the objective in a completely different way.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The design of the database helper class was the component of the application where I think it took the most "outside" knowledge to achieve good results. I was able to apply some of my past SQL experience to create a database helper class that faciliated all of the CRUD functionality for the application.
